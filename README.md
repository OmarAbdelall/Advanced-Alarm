## Introduction
The Advanced Alarm project demonstrates a variety of Java programming concepts, including GUI development with Swing, multithreading, and basic networking using sockets.<br>
The alarm system has several components like a Stopwatch, a Loading animation, and a Ring function that triggers sound playback when the timer runs out.<br>

## Features
* Stopwatch: A timer that counts down from user-specified hours, minutes, and seconds.<br>
* Loading Animation: A graphical animation showing a moving green ball.<br>
* Alarm Ringing: Plays a sound when the timer reaches zero.<br>
* Client-Server Communication: The server sends a message allowing the client to set a timer.<br>
